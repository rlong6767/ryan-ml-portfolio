# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning techniques.  
- Preprocessing: handled missing values, one-hot encoding, scaling  
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC  

## Files
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing and modeling  
- `data/` – (if included) sample datasets  
- `results/` – model performance metrics
